Basically its just sending a request to the dns resolvers 

        host myip.opendns.com resolver1.opendns.com

If you want a shorter one, you could curl/wget from some services (at the expense of security)
        curl ifconfig.me
        curl icanhazip.com
        curl ipecho.net/plain
        curl ifconfig.co
